NAME
    RT-Extension-ManageAutoCreatedUsers - Manage auto-created users

DESCRIPTION
    This extension provides a tool to easy the management of auto-created
    users.

    For each auto-created user, the tool shows tickets that they are a
    watcher of, and offer the choice of:

    No action
    Shred, replacing with an alternate user
    Shred entirely
    Merge with an alternate user
    Mark as valid

    The tool attempts to supply a suggested user to merge into based on a
    simple heuristic which assumes the correct email address from the
    RTxAutoUserMailDomain config option. If any of the options are selected,
    the user will not appear in the listing again.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.2
